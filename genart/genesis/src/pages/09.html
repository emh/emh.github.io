            Day 8, "Chaos". <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_attractor">Strange attractors</a> are a classic example of chaotic systems, where small changes in initial conditions lead to vastly different outcomes. Here, I implemented a variation of the De Jong attractor.

            The sketch picks random parameters for the equations and then plots the points generated by iterating the equations from a starting point. The result is a complex, swirling pattern that never exactly repeats, demonstrating the sensitive dependence on initial conditions characteristic of chaotic systems.
