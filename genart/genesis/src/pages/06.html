            Day 6, "Morph". In 1952 Alan Turing published a paper titled <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf">"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis"</a> in which he proposed a reaction-diffusion model to explain how patterns in nature (like stripes on zebras or spots on leopards) could arise naturally from a homogeneous state.

            The <a target="_blank" href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/amorphous/GrayScott/">Gray-Scott</a> model is a specific type of reaction-diffusion system that produces a variety of complex patterns through the interaction of two chemicals, often referred to as "A" and "B". In this implementation, I used the Gray-Scott equations to simulate the diffusion and reaction of these chemicals on a 2D grid, resulting in dynamic, evolving patterns that resemble those found in nature.
