            Day 16, "Formula". Parametric equations can draw some very complex and beautiful curves. One example is the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superformula">Superformula</a> developed by Johan Gielis which can represent a wide variety of natural shapes.

            I implemented the Superformula and and used my noise functions to slowly morph the parameters of the equation over time to get a sense of the variety of curves it can produce.
