            Day 15, "Growth". I had this theme seeded before I knew how I wanted to express it and then I stumbled on the phrase 
            "differential line growth" - seemed relevant. As I explored the algorithm I detected a lot of overlap with the 
            force directed graph layout I played with in <a href="viewer.html#graph" target="_blank">graph</a> and the flocking
            beaviour in <a href="viewer.html#emerge" target="_blank">emerge</a>.

            Typical implementations initiialize with a simple line or circle but I used the polyline from 
            <a href="viewer.html#shape" target="_blank">shape</a>. I also reused the fill logic - when you are satisfied with the 
            shape of the curve you can pause the growth and have it paint the interior.
