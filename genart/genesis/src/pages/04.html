            Day 4, "Noise". I was aware of noise functions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a> and how they could be used to create natural looking transitions but I'd never used them. So I implemented the Perlin noise algorithm and applied it the the colour and size of a grid of circles.
