            Day 2, "Shape". I've been seeing a lot of "meditative scribble colouring" posts on IG lately and I wanted to try recreating that feel algorithmically.

            I also wanted to explore using bezier curves. A little research (aka late night chats with the bot) led me to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline">algorithm</a> for creating a smooth curve from a series of points. That got me the scribbles. Then they needed to be coloured in.

            I used a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill">flood fill</a> algorithm to fill in the shapes created by the overlapping curves.
