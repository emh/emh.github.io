            Day 19, "Constraint". Inspired by the art of Kazimir Malevich I set out to create compositions of simple gemotric shapes and limited palettes that adhered to specific spatial constraints.

            Shapes are randomly placed on the canvas along the path of a cubic Bezier curve. Each shape must not overlap. And, the shapes are all aligned along a randomly oriented grid.
