            Day 14, "Emerge". An implementation of Craig Reynolds' <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boids</a> algorithm for simulating flocking behavior in birds. Each boid follows three simple rules: separation (avoid crowding neighbors), alignment (steer towards average heading of neighbors), and cohesion (steer towards average position of neighbors).
        </p>
        <p>
            The boids are then rendered with a mesh connecting nearby boids to create an emergent, organic structure that evolves over time.
