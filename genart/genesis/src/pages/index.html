    This is a 30 day challenge where I create a piece of generative art each day based on a daily theme.
    The goal is to build a toolkit of techniques and algorithms that I can then draw on for future projects.
    The themes are self-selected -- I have a high level map of the territory I want to explore, but the details
    are flexible and emergent. I fully expect new themes to arise as I work through the month.
