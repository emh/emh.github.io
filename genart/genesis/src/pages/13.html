            Day 13, "Seed". I don't know that I realized my vision for today but I learned a lot. The idea was to have a population of agents/particles that evolve over time to consume the "food" laid down along the path of a random fourier curve.

            Each agent has a genome that encodes a sequence of actions (move forward, turn left, turn right). Each generation, the fittest agents are selected to breed and create a new generation with crossover and mutation. The fitness function rewards agents for consuming food and for covering new ground.
