            Day 17, "Move". This piece simulates a series of double pendulums, each starting from slightly different initial conditions. Double pendulums are a classic example of a chaotic system, where small differences in starting positions lead to vastly different outcomes over time.

            Only the path of the second pendulum bob is traced, creating intricate and colorful patterns as the pendulums swing. Each pendulum is assigned a unique hue based on its index to enhance the visual complexity.
