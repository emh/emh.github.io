I'm going to try this writing thing again. I used to write online fairly regularly before [twitter](https://twitter.com/emh) statuses, [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/evanhaveman) posts, and [instagram](http://instagram.com/emh) selfies took over - but none of that captures the longer form writing I aspire to do.

I'll mostly write about software design, because that's what I do. You may also find posts about steak, tequila, exercise, photography, travel, or whatever else I feel like writing about. I'll try and tag everything appropriately so you can separate the signal from the noise.

If you're curious how this was all put together, it's simple: [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Just don't make the mistake I did and assume you can run your blog anywhere but out of the top-level folder. Read [this](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages).
